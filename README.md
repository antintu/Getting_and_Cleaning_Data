2) Link to a Github repository with the script for performing further analysis
3) A code book that describes:
  - the variables
  - the data
  - transformations or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
